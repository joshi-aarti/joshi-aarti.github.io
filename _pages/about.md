Hi! I’m Arati, a passionate cloud platform engineer with a strong background in designing scalable, secure, and automated infrastructure solutions across **Azure and AWS**. I have extensive experience working with **Spring Boot** for backend systems and **Python** for automation, scripting, and data-driven applications.

Over the years, I’ve taken on roles as a **DevOps engineer**, **solution architect**, and **platform enabler**, building internal frameworks and self-service tools that help engineering teams ship faster and more reliably. I’m also an **AI enthusiast**, exploring how machine learning and generative AI can be applied to platform automation, support workflows, and cloud intelligence.

As a **full-time working mom** and part of the **small but growing community of women in platform engineering space**, I’m passionate about representation and balancing career with personal growth. Outside of work, I enjoy learning about **Vedic astrology** — a field that feeds my curiosity about patterns, timing, and the unseen connections in life and technology.

This site is a space where I share insights, tutorials, and reflections from my journey — at the intersection of cloud, automation, AI, and life.
