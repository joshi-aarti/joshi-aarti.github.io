Let me be honest: I’m a software engineer, and yet for years, I couldn’t get myself to build a personal portfolio website.

And I had **plenty of excuses** — valid ones too.

- I’m not good at UI/UX design.
- CSS? Ugh. Fonts, colors, spacing, padding — never my strong suit.
- I didn’t want to pay for premium templates. Customizing them felt more painful than starting from scratch.
- Hosting fees seemed silly when I *knew* it could be free.
- And on top of that? I’m a mom, with about 100 other things constantly on my plate.

I tried a few times over the years. Started a repo. Tweaked a theme. Then dropped it. Back to the backlog it went.

### What Changed?

Recently, I got to work with a static site generator called **Jekyll**. That opened a door.

I started learning about:
- **GitHub Pages** (free hosting!)
- **Minimal Mistakes** theme (clean and customizable)
- **Liquid templates** (not scary at all!)
- Writing content in simple `.md` files

And the game-changer? **ChatGPT**.

I didn’t spend more than 4 hours total. Whenever I got stuck, I’d just ask:  
> “How do I hide the sidebar on this page?” or  
> “Where do I change the font size in this theme?”

Little by little, my website came to life: [https://aarti.life](https://aarti.life)

It’s not the fanciest site out there, but it’s mine. And now I have an **easy, repeatable way** to publish blogs and projects — without touching a single CSS file unless I really want to.

### What Goes Into a Website, Really?

I used to think I needed to learn *everything* to build a site. But you don’t. Here are the **core components** that bring a website together:

| Component               | What I Used                    | Purpose                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hosting Platform**    | GitHub Pages                  | Free static site hosting, integrated with Jekyll                        |
| **Domain Purchase**     | Namecheap                     | Bought `aarti.life`                                                    |
| **Domain Registration** | Also handled via Namecheap    | They register and manage the domain for me                             |
| **SSL Certificate**     | Provided automatically by GitHub Pages | Enables `https://` without any manual work                        |
| **UI Template**         | Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme | A beautiful, responsive layout that's ready to go                      |
| **Customization**       | Markdown files + Liquid layout edits | Personalized content, menus, and look                                 |
| **Your Content**        | Markdown blog posts, project pages | The heart of your website – your voice and ideas                      |

You don’t need to be a designer. You don’t need to pay for hosting. You just need the right tools that work *with* you, not against you.

### How Jekyll + GitHub Pages + Namecheap All Fit Together

- **Jekyll**: Converts your simple Markdown files into a fully working website using themes and layouts.
- **Minimal Mistakes Theme**: A popular Jekyll theme that looks beautiful out of the box and is easy to tweak.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosts your website for free and understands Jekyll natively — so no build pipeline or deployment scripts needed.
- **Namecheap**: I bought my domain `aarti.life` from here. I updated my domain’s DNS to point to GitHub Pages, and it just works.

And that’s it! With just these tools, I had a custom domain, secure HTTPS, and a live site — without a single server or hosting bill.

### Why I’m Sharing This

If you’re a developer (especially a woman juggling work and life) who’s been meaning to create your own site but just… never did — I see you.

You don’t need to master UI/UX.  
You don’t need to spend money.  
You don’t need a free weekend (what’s that anyway? 😄)

All you need is:
- A bit of curiosity
- A few Markdown files
- Some help from tools like ChatGPT
- And maybe this little nudge from someone who’s been there

### Want to Try It Yourself?

I’m writing a follow-up tutorial that walks through:
- How Jekyll works (and what a static site generator even is)
- What folders like `_layouts`, `_posts`, and `_config.yml` do
- How I customized the Minimal Mistakes theme
- Step-by-step setup using GitHub Pages and a custom domain
- How everything fits together to make a live, working site

If that sounds interesting, stay tuned here or drop me a message through [aarti.life](https://aarti.life).

You *can* do this. Even if you’ve been telling yourself you can’t. 💻❤️
